The notebook __code/figure_reproduction.ipynb__ reproduces most figures from **Lehr, Luboeinski & Tetzlaff, 2022**. It uses __nmAnalysisClass.py__ found in the __analysis/__ folder of this repository. There you will find the relevant methods used for data analysis, statistics, and figure generation.

**IMPORTANT.** First get the raw data from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6981746](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6981746) and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/raw_data/* to be able to run the notebook. If you also download the processed data and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/processed_data/* then most analysis will be skipped automatically and it will take the already analysed/processed data. This is of course faster if you do not want to reproduce everything.
