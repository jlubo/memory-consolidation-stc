The notebook __code/figure_reproduction.ipynb__ reproduces most figures from **Lehr, Luboeinski & Tetzlaff, 2022**. It uses __nmAnalysisClass.py__ found in the __analysis/__ folder of this repository. There you will find the relevant methods used for data analysis, statistics, and figure generation.

**IMPORTANT.** First get the raw data from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6981746](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6981746) and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/raw_data/* to be able to run the notebook. If you also download the processed data and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/processed_data/* then most analysis will be skipped automatically and it will take the already analysed/processed data. This is of course faster if you do not want to reproduce everything.

For the paper, the code was run using Ubuntu 20.04 with python package versions listed in __requirements.txt__. Ideally you should create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required packages using __pip install -r requirements.txt__, get the data from the link above, then launch the notebook to reproduce the figures.
