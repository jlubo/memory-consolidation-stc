# Basic early- and late-phase dynamics
***
####


The notebook __code/figure_reproduction.ipynb__ reproduces data on basic early- and late-phase plasticity dynamics. This has also been done in an [implementation with the Arbor simulator](https://github.com/jlubo/arbor_network_consolidation). The notebook here uses the C++ code and the build scripts found in the __simulation-code/__ folder of this repository, as well as the run scripts in the __simulation-bin/__ folder, and the script __averageFileColumnsAdvanced.py__ found in the __analysis/__ folder of this repository.
